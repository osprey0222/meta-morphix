# Metamorphix

A comprehensive productivity software built using Typscript, React, Node.js, Firebase and MongoDB. This platform assists registered users in organizing their daily schedules, managing tasks, and storing important files efficiently. Furthermore, it offers insightful progress tracking through visually appealing charts such as heatmaps and radar charts. Users also receive email notifications for important tasks and can assign priority levels to each tasks. The integration of libraries like React-Query, moment.js, material-ui enhances the user experience.

Upcoming features include the addition of a monthly "streak" feature, enabling users to effortlessly monitor and visualize their task completion consistency over each month. This enhancement will provide a clear view of progress and overall performance. Also, I am planning to add a "mentor" feature that will connect users with their mentors who can help them.

I loved building this project. Debouncing and Throtting is something which seems easy but when you start implemening it (especially for API calls) you understand its complexity.


Tech Stack and Other "fantastic" things:

1. Next.js (because why not!)
2. MongoDB
3. Node.js
4. React Query (state management)
5. Moment ⏲️
6. Firebase
7. etc etc...
